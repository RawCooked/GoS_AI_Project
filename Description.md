Project Description: Cognitive and Creative Talent Assessment for Children
This project is designed to assess and identify different aspects of children's cognitive abilities and creative talents across three core domains: mathematical-logical intelligence, artistic skills, and musical performance. By analyzing test papers, drawings, and musical performances, the project aims to provide valuable insights into children's development, creativity, and potential.

1. Mathematical-Logical Intelligence Assessment:
This branch focuses on evaluating children's problem-solving skills and logical reasoning through math exercises from the Tunisian Ministry of Education workbook. The system analyzes their responses to determine both the correctness of their answers and their creativity in solving the problems, even when answers deviate from traditional methods.

Objective: To detect children's logical thinking, problem-solving approaches, and creativity in math.

2. Artistic Talent Detection:
This branch assesses children's artistic abilities based on their drawings. By analyzing their artwork, the system evaluates their creativity, composition, and use of shapes, lines, and color. The aim is to identify children with strong artistic potential and encourage their creative expression.

Objective: To evaluate children's artistic skills, creativity, and ability to express themselves visually.

3. Musical Performance Analysis:
The third branch evaluates musical performance by analyzing video recordings of children playing musical instruments or singing. The system assesses their rhythm, timing, and overall performance quality to gauge their musical talent and proficiency.

Objective: To assess musical abilities, including rhythm, pitch, and overall musical expression.

Project Vision:
The project aims to provide personalized insights for teachers and parents by identifying children’s strengths and talents in key areas: math, art, and music. By automating the evaluation process, the system can generate detailed reports that help tailor educational approaches to each child’s needs. This early identification of talents can shape how children are nurtured, whether in curriculum development, extracurricular activities, or overall personal growth.

The system fosters a more objective approach to understanding and supporting children's creativity, providing teachers and parents with actionable feedback that encourages further development and exploration of their abilities.
