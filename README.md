# GoS_AI_Project

## 🧠 Overview
**GoS_AI_Project** is a deep learning system combining **image classification** and **object detection**. Designed for smart educational or security applications, this project uses powerful neural networks to recognize and detect objects in images, with a focus on deployment efficiency and accuracy.

---

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Image classification using pretrained CNN models (ResNet, VGG16, MobileNet)
- 🎯 Image Classification with custom datasets
- 📊 Performance metrics visualization (Accuracy, F1-Score, etc.)
- 🧠 Future-ready with support for self-supervised learning and edge deployment

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### 🔹 Frontend
- **React** (for future real-time monitoring dashboard or visual results display)

### 🔹 Backend
- **Django** (REST API for serving predictions and managing models)

### 🔹 Deep Learning Frameworks
- **TensorFlow** / **Keras**
- **PyTorch**

### 🔹 Other Tools
- OpenCV – Image manipulation  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn – Visualization  
- Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation  
- Scikit-learn – Evaluation metrics  
- Flask / FastAPI – Lightweight deployment 
- Unsloth / LoRA - llm fine tuning
